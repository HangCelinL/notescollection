# Notescollection

My first personal project. First commmit included setup of web server, spring mySQL and basic functionality.
The final product will be a website which will serve as a personal wikipendium. It will be a collection of my notes for my subjects. 

## Language and tools
Backend is built with java, spring, hibernate and mySQL database. Planning to build frontend with Node.js and React.js.
